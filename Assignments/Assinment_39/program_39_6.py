# Features Description
# • StudyHours – Number of hours a student studies per day.
# • Attendance – Percentage of class attendance.
# • PreviousScore – Marks obtained in the previous examination.
# • AssignmentsCompleted – Number of assignments completed by the student.
# • SleepHours – Average number of hours the student sleeps per day.
# • FinalResult – Target variable (Output):
# ◦ 1 → Pass
# ◦ 0 → Fail

# 6. Train three Decision Tree models with:
# • max_depth = 1
# • max_depth = 3
# • max_depth = None
# Compare their testing accuracies and write your observations.
