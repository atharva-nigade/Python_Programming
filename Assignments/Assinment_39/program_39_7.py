# Features Description
# • StudyHours – Number of hours a student studies per day.
# • Attendance – Percentage of class attendance.
# • PreviousScore – Marks obtained in the previous examination.
# • AssignmentsCompleted – Number of assignments completed by the student.
# • SleepHours – Average number of hours the student sleeps per day.
# • FinalResult – Target variable (Output):
# ◦ 1 → Pass
# ◦ 0 → Fail

# 7. Use the trained model to predict result for a student with:
    
# • StudyHours = 6
# • Attendance = 85
# • PreviousScore = 66
# • AssignmentsCompleted = 7
# • SleepHours = 7
# Will the student Pass or Fail?
