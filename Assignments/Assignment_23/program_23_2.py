# # 2. Write a Python program to implement a class named BankAccount with the following requirements:
# #   -> The class should contain two instance variables:
# #       -> Name (Account holder name)
# #       -> Amount (Account balance)
# #   -> The class should contain one class variable:
# #       -> ROT (Rate of Interest), initialized to 10.5
# #   -> Define a constructor (init) that accepts Name and initial Amount.
# #   -> Implement the following instance methods:
# #       -> Display() - displays account holder name and current balance
# #       -> Deposit() - accepts an amount from the user and adds it to balance
# #       -> Withdraw() - accepts an amount from the user and subtracts it from balance (Ensure withdrawal 
# #           is allowed only if sufficient balance exists)
# #       -> CalculateInterest() - calculates and returns interest using formula
# #           Interest = (Amount * ROT) / 100
